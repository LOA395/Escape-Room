# Escape Room Game

Welcome to the **Escape Room Game** repository! This project is a text-based adventure game implemented in Python. The goal of the game is to explore different rooms and escape by solving puzzles, finding keys, and progressing through different stages.

## Overview

The project is designed to strengthen Python skills and problem-solving abilities. In this game, the player navigates through various rooms (Game Room, Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Living Room) and tries to make it "Outside" by collecting keys and unlocking doors in a specific sequence. The entire game is built using fundamental Python concepts like dictionaries, functions, loops, and error handling.

### Game Narrative

Suddenly, you find yourself on an unfamiliar couch in a mysterious house without windows. Your mission is simple: **escape**. Each room contains unique challenges that must be solved to proceed, such as finding hidden keys or unlocking doors. Will you make it out before the looming danger catches up?

## Project Structure

The repository consists of the following key files:

- `Escape_Room.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook is used to initiate the game, allowing you to easily run and interact with the game logic through Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- `functions.py`: A Python script containing the game's core logic and functions, such as setting up rooms, handling game state, and navigating between rooms.

### Core Components

1. **Data Structures**: The game uses dictionaries and lists to store information about rooms, keys, and the current state.
2. **Game Flow**: Functions are used to encapsulate different actions like exploring rooms, using items, and moving between locations.
3. **Error Handling**: The code incorporates error handling techniques to ensure that incorrect inputs are managed smoothly.
4. **Control Flow**: The game utilizes if-elif-else statements and loops to control the sequence of actions based on player inputs.

## Setup

To play the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Escape-Room-Game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Escape-Room-Game
   ```
3. Run the game script:
   ```sh
   python functions.py
   ```

Alternatively, you can open the `Escape_Room.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the game interactively.

## How to Play

1. The game begins in the **Game Room**. You can choose to explore the items in the room to discover a key.
2. Use the discovered key to unlock doors and move to the next rooms.
3. Continue exploring and unlocking rooms until you reach **Outside**, the final goal.
4. Make your decisions by typing commands such as `explore`, `examine`, and specifying items or doors.
